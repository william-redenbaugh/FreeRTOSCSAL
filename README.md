# FreeRTOSCSAL: Software Abstraction Library for FreeRTOS Platforms

This repository contains a software abstraction library (CSAL) for FreeRTOS platforms. The library provides a set of functions and utilities to simplify the development of applications using FreeRTOS.

## Purpose and Functionality
The purpose of this library is to abstract away the low-level details of FreeRTOS and provide a higher-level interface for developers. It includes functions for managing threads, mutexes, semaphores, and other common FreeRTOS features.

## Usage
To use this library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the necessary header files in your project.
3. Link against the CSAL library.
4. Use the provided functions and utilities to manage threads, mutexes, semaphores, and other FreeRTOS features.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation.

## Dependencies
This library has the following dependencies:
- FreeRTOS
- Arduino (for the OS_MISC functionality)

Please make sure to install these dependencies before using the library.
